# 📊 AddMe Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **AddMe Project** is a SQL-based data analysis project that processes customer orders, book details, and transactional data to generate insights. This project involves **database design, data manipulation, and query optimization** to ensure efficient data retrieval and analysis.  

## 📂 Project Files  
- **📄 Orders.csv** - Contains order transaction details.  
- **📄 Books.csv** - Contains book-related information.  
- **📄 Customers.csv** - Contains customer details and demographics.  
- **📜 Day-30-SQL-Project.sql** - SQL script with queries for data analysis and insights extraction.  

## 🚀 What I Did in This Project  

### 🔹 1. Data Preparation  
✅ Cleaned and formatted datasets (`Orders.csv`, `Books.csv`, `Customers.csv`).  
✅ Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.  
✅ Transformed raw data into a structured format for database insertion.  

### 🔹 2. Database Design & Setup  
✅ Created **relational tables** for storing customers, books, and orders.  
✅ Established **primary and foreign key relationships** for better data integrity.  
✅ Optimized database schema for efficient querying.  

### 🔹 3. SQL Queries & Data Analysis  
✅ Designed **JOINs** to combine multiple datasets.  
✅ Used **GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY** for aggregated reports.  
✅ Implemented **subqueries and CTEs** for complex data retrieval.  
✅ Identified **top-selling books, frequent customers, and revenue trends**.  

### 🔹 4. Challenges Faced  
🔸 **Data Cleaning** – Dealing with missing or inconsistent records.  
🔸 **Query Optimization** – Ensuring efficient execution for large datasets.  
🔸 **Complex Joins** – Handling relationships between multiple tables.  

### 🔹 5. Tools & Technologies Used  
🛠️ **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (whichever applies).  
🛠️ **Query Language**: SQL.  
🛠️ **Data Format**: CSV for structured data storage.  
🛠️ **Development Tools**: SQL Workbench / pgAdmin / DBeaver (mention the tool you used).  

### 🔹 6. Future Improvements  
✅ Implement **indexes** to improve query performance.  
✅ Create **stored procedures** for automating repetitive queries.  
✅ Build a **dashboard** using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) or Power BI for visual insights.  
✅ Integrate **triggers** for real-time data updates.
